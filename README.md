# jsar

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the `jsar` package is to provide a comprehensive toolset
that collates functions from both the data science and analyst
communities. By bringing together a diverse range of functions into one
package, it simplifies the process of accessing and utilizing these
resources, thereby offering invaluable help to users. This ease of
access not only reduces the time spent searching for the right tools but
also increases overall productivity, enabling analysts to focus more on
deriving insights and less on manual processes. Furthermore, the `jsar`
package is designed to foster collaboration across teams by providing a
unified platform where team members can share and leverage the same
tools and data structures. This collaborative environment encourages
consistency, enhances communication, and ultimately drives more
effective and innovative problem-solving.
